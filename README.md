## Cached Queries With Nodejs

I'm still a CFML coder at heart, so this is a personal project to replicate something similar to CFML Query Caching. It demonstrates how to set up a Node.js application with a RDBMS (SQLite3 for now) and Redis for caching query results. Each userâ€™s query results are cached uniquely based on their user ID and query parameters. This setup aims to replicate caching of queries.

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following content. This file will store your Redis connection details securely.

```plaintext
# .env

# The hostname or IP address of your Redis server
REDISHOST="localhost"

# The port number on which your Redis server is running
REDISPORT="6379"

# The password for your Redis server (if applicable)
REDISPW="passwd"
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andyj/cached-queries-with-nodejs.git
   cd cached-queries-with-nodejs
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Access the example route:**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8001/data`.
3. **Output**
   - The output should be a time stamp `[{"time()":"09:38:46"}]` which does not change for 5 seconds.
